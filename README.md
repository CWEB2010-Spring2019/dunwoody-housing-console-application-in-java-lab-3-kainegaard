# Dunwoody Housing Console Application

You are going to build a console application that requires you enter resident data into the program. The end-user will should be able to select which type of resident they would like to enter int the application.  One the user is done entering resident data, the application will output each user entered.

## Instructions

Similar to project 3, create a console application that allows a Resident Director to continually create new residents who reside in the newly constructed Dunwoody residence hall.  Once the Director has finished entering all residents, a list of each resident by category will be printed to the console.   Each resident will have a random id number (6 numeric characters), first name, last name, dorm room number, and monthly rent/fee and floor they reside on.  Residents include student workers, scholarship recipients and athletes.  Each resident is responsible for paying monthly rent/fee.  Scholarship recipients pay a flat boarding fee of $100 monthly, Student Athletes pay $1200 monthly and student workers’ pay $1245 a month minus half of their monthly student worker pay (which is calculated by taking the monthly hours worked * base hourly rate).  The base hourly rate for a student worker is $14.00.  There are 8 floors, student workers only reside on floors 1- 3, student athletes reside on floors 4 – 6 and scholarship residents reside on floors 7 and 8.



## Requirements
- Application should be a Java console application.
- Version control implemeted into application with a minimum of 5 commits beyond original commits provided.
- Make sure master branch is able to successfully compile 
- ReadMe file is included with project that gives instructions on what the project is and what technologies were used in creating the project.
- Utilize JOptionPane methods that request user input.
- Implement class structure that inherits from an Abstract class of resident.
